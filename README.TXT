A predator-prey simulation involving predators, preys and plants in
an enclosed rectangular field. The field's environment represents 
a jungle where animals and plants intereact between each other
(see full description in the report).

This is the final version of the simulation. This version
uses inheritance as the 5 animal species can be divided into 
predators and preys.
